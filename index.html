                <h3>Who are we?</h3>
                <p>Muddy Paws Rescue Centre was founded in 2020, following the large number of dogs that were abandoned
                    during the pandemic.</p>
                <p>We started with a small room in a house with only a couple of cages, and now have
                    been able to make space for six dogs on our farm. We also have a small field for the dogs to
                    socialise
                    and play.</p>
                <p>Our staff are highly trained and have all the dogs best intentions at heart. We also have a
                    medical room and on call vet.</p>

                <h3>About the dogs</h3>
                <p>All dogs we rescue are nursed back to health, groomed and well fed before they're ready to be
                    adopted. We
                    also neuter / spay, vaccinated and microchip all rescue dogs.</p>
                <p>Our on-call vet will give an age and basic medical history about the dogs shortly after they arrive.
                    If
                    we have
                    information about the dog, we
                    will be able to discuss this with you when you visit, and can give you a copy of their records when
                    you
                    adopt.</p>
