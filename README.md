## Competitor Review

---

I have assessed three different type of competitors for this project. First, [Dogs Trust](https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/) which is a large organisation with several rescue centres around the country. The second is [Birmingham Dogs Home](https://birminghamdogshome.org.uk/), a medium sized local dogs home in Birmingham with two centres. Lastly is the [Freedom of Spirit Trust for Border Collies (FOSTBC)](https://www.fostbc.org.uk/) which is an independent dogs home specifically for Border Collies based in Leeds.

### **Pros**

- Dogs Trust
  - Great use of spacing with text and images. Video on landing page draws the user in
- Birmingham Dogs home
  - Consistent use of circles and handwriting-like fonts to create a more “fun” feeling to the website and adoption process
  - “Find a dog” search fixed to the top of every page
- FOSTBC
  - Lots of pictures to draw the user in
  - Great use of colours - green and white makes the text clear and easy to read


### **Cons**

- Dogs Trust
  - Contact us page - user has to scroll to nearly to bottom for contact information
  - Breadcrumb feature inconsistent - House icon used for Home, but then text used for the rest of the breadcrumb
- FOSTBC
  - Hero image and logo too large - the landing page has no immediate information when opened, but you can't see any images either
  - There is a lot of text and content on each page, users may find this an overload
- Birmingham Dogs home
  - Large pictures and text on homepage make the website look a little crowded

## User Stories

---

My target audience for Muddy Paws Rescue Centre is going to be families with children, and couples.

### **Families with Kids**

> A family of four is looking to adopt a dog that is good with young children. To do this, they will need to look at the different types and breeds of dogs available on the website before they visit. They will have to bring the children to the Rescue Centre, so they will need to make sure there is a dog they want to see before they go. They also want to look at what age the dogs are, as they want one that is quite young, but doesn't need long walks in the week.

### **Couples**

> A couple in their mid-30s are looking for an active dog. They have a caravan and enjoy travelling the country, so need a dog that likes lots of exercise and isn't likely to run away when nervous. They have plenty of room and would prefer a medium or large sized dog. They live in the countryside, the centre is a 40 minute drive from them. Because of this, they want to be sure there is a dog they'd like to see before making the drive.
